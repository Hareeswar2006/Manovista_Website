                        <p>A Partnership firm is a dynamic business structure where two or more individuals unite to manage and operate a business. Their roles and objectives are meticulously outlined in a legally binding <strong>Partnership Deed</strong>. This structure is collectively owned, managed, and controlled by an association of people with the primary aim of generating profit.</p>
                        <p>Partnership firms are renowned for their relative ease of establishment and are a popular choice among small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in various unorganized sectors across India.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the core elements that define a partnership is crucial for its smooth and successful operation.</p>
